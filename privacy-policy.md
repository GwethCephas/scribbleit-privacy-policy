Thank you for using ScribbleIt.

This Privacy Policy outlines how ScribbleIt handles your information. We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about our practices.

## 1. Data Collection

ScribbleIt **does not collect**, store, or transmit any personal data. All notes and information you create using the app are stored **locally on your device only**.

We do not:
- Collect any personal information
- Store any data on our servers (because we don't have any!)

## 2. Permissions

ScribbleIt may request access to device storage only to allow you to save and manage your notes locally. This data is **not shared or accessed** by anyone else.

## 3. Security

Because all data stays on your device, you retain full control over your information. We recommend using your device’s built-in security features (such as screen locks or encryption) to keep your notes secure.

## 4. Third-Party Services

ScribbleIt does not integrate with any third-party services or SDKs that collect user data.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes to our app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a revised effective date.
